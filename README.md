# CML_labs

These are CML labs based off of Neil Anderson's CCNP ENCOR course that I wish to couple with automated tasks. Even my focus will be on the upcoming CCNP WLCOR exam (slated March 19, 2026) for a
formal certificate, it is indisputable that the depth of the 350-401 ENCOR, and even the 300-410 ENARSI, is the gold standard for any aspiring network engineer. It also should be noted that 
automation is only becoming more of a pressing need in today's environment, even as it branches out to small businesses.
